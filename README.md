# Small Network Lab

## Objective
The Small Network Lab aimed to construct a simulated network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer, integrating subnetting and VLANs to enhance network segmentation. The primary focus was to design and implement subnetting schemes to optimize IP address allocation and VLAN configurations to logically segregate network traffic. This hands-on experience provided practical insights into network segmentation, IP addressing, and VLAN deployment, fostering a deeper understanding of network security principles and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

-Fluency in network design.
-Mastery of subnetting techniques for efficient IP address allocation.
-Strategic deployment of VLANs to improve network scalability and management.
-Proficiency in ensuring seamless operation of network devices and services.
